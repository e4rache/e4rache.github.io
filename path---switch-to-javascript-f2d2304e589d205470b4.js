Code is easier to write but requires more testing to ensure correctness\nThe npm/yarn package management system is excellent and joyful to use, versus the abomination that is Maven\nBoth Java and Node.js offer excellent performance, running counter to the myth that JavaScript is slow and therefore Node.js performance must be bad\nNode.js performance is riding the coattails of Google investment in V8 to speed up the Chrome browser\nThe intense competition between browsers is making JavaScript more and more powerful every year, benefitting Node.js</p>\n<p><a href="blog.sourcerer.io">https://blog.sourcerer.io/why-is-a-java-guy-so-excited-about-node-js-and-javascript-7cfc423efb44</a></p>',frontmatter:{path:"/switch-to-javascript",title:"Why I switched from Java to JavaScript / Node.js",date:"2018-08-28"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
